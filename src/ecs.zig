///
/// - Plain `Entity`: purely a container for other `Entity`s.
/// - Component `Entity`: has some associated data, can be added to another `Entity`.
/// - System `Entity`: contains logic for modifying other `Entity`s.
///
/// Because there is no hard seperation between `Entity`s, components and systems,
/// they can often be used interchangeably. Where you would usually only add a component `Entity` to
/// an `Entity`, you can also add a plain `Entity`. This is often called a "tag" (a data-less component).
/// On top of that, systems can contain components, and can be created and deleted dynamically.
