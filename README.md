# Otter Engine

Otter is a work-in-progress game engine.

## Goals

* **Features**: Offer anything and everything needed to build your dream game.
* **Portable**: Impose no limits on what type of hardware a game can run on.
* **Modular**: Make it easy to hook into, modify, or replace parts of the engine.
* **Efficient**: Games should run quickly, and not perform wasteful work. Games
should perform well without draining batteries too quickly.
* **Simple yet powerful**: It should be easy to get started with otter,
and also provide the tools needed for complex workflows.
